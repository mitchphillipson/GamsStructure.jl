To Do:

1. Speed up indexing on parameters. Currently it is ~3-4x slower than NamedArrays
2. Documentation. Needs massive updating
3. Tests. Need more and more comprehensive
4. Lots of places call field names rather than with a function. Needs changing. 


History:

To Do:

1. Deprecate and remove GamsScalars. 

Ideas for future addition:

1. Dataframe to parameter. 
    1. Something where it will make the set at the same time
4. Make parameters print better.
5. Search over descriptions
6. Write unit tests
7.
