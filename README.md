# GamsStructure.jl
 
Ideas for future addition:

1. Dataframe to parameter. 
    1. Something where it will make the set at the same time
2. Have parameter have an optional columns argument so you can specify columns
3. ~Zero dimensional parameters (or constants)~ Implemented as GamsScalars
4. Make parameters print better.
5. Search over descriptions
6. Load/Save a GamsUniverse in a meaningful way. Load/Save formats
    1. CSV -> Loading implemented
    2. ZIP -> Perhaps a nice way to save a bunch of data at once. Can include a JSON file or something for all information. 
7. Write unit tests
8.
